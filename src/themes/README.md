# Swwwift Themes

Swwwift themes are stored as configuration files in\
`/wp-content/uploads/swwwift_themes/swft_{theme_name}_swwwift`.

Each directory should have the following structure when completed:

```
/swft_{theme_name}_swwwift
  swft_{theme_name}_swwwift.json
  theme.css*
  /content
    import.xml
  /block-patterns*
    /{block_category}
      [list_of_patterns.json]
```

* = Optional

Your theme should be developed in the same order as is followed in this documentation to accurately achieve the model seen above.

Images to help will be added to this documentation at a later stage.
